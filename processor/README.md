# Novalnet Payment Integration Processor

This module provides a backend service based on [commercetools Connect](https://docs.commercetools.com/connect) that processes payment operations initiated from commercetools Checkout and communicates with the Novalnet Payment Gateway.

The processor is responsible for creating payments, handling direct and redirect payment flows, processing webhooks, synchronizing commercetools Payments and Orders, and maintaining transaction history throughout the payment lifecycle.

## Features

- Direct payment processing
- Redirect payment processing
- Authorization and Payment modes
- Configurable minimum amount for authorization
- Guaranteed payment validation
- Webhook handling
- Localized transaction comments (English and German)


---

## Running the Application

Configuration is loaded from:

```
processor/src/config/config.ts
```

using environment variables supplied through:

- `connect.yaml`
- commercetools Connect deployment configuration

The commercetools API Client must include the following scopes.

- `manage_payments`
- `manage_orders`
- `manage_types`
- `view_types`
- `manage_checkout_payment_intents`
- `view_sessions`
- `introspect_oauth_tokens`

---

## Authentication

The processor supports multiple authentication mechanisms.

- `oauth2`
- `session`
- `jwt`

### OAuth2

The connector authenticates with commercetools using OAuth2 credentials configured through Connect.

For details refer to the commercetools OAuth documentation.

### Session

The connector relies on commercetools Session Service to exchange information between the Enabler and Processor.

Example:

```http
POST https://session.<region>.commercetools.com/<project-key>/sessions
Authorization: Bearer <token>

{
  "cart": {
    "cartRef": {
      "id": "<cart-id>"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "allowedPaymentMethods": [
      "CREDITCARD",
      "PAYPAL",
      "DIRECT_DEBIT_SEPA"
    ]
  }
}
```

The returned Session ID must be supplied as:

```
x-session-id
```

### JWT

For local development:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Obtain a JWT:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/jwt/token
```

Use:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```
